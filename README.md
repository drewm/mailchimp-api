MailChimp API
=============

Super-simple, minimum abstraction MailChimp API v3 wrapper, in PHP.

For API v3 version, see the [api-v3 branch](https://github.com/drewm/mailchimp-api/tree/api-v3).

I hate complex wrappers. This lets you get from the MailChimp API docs to the code as directly as possible.

Requires PHP 5.3 and a pulse. Abstraction is for chimps.

Installation
------------

You can install the mailchimp-api using Composer:

```
composer require drewm/mailchimp-api
```

You will then need to:
* run ``composer install`` to get these dependencies added to your vendor directory
* add the autoloader to your application with this line: ``require("vendor/autoload.php")``

Alternatively you can just download the MailChimp.php file and include it manually.

Examples
--------

List all the mailing lists (`lists` method)

```php
use \DrewM\MailChimp\MailChimp;

$MailChimp = new MailChimp('abc123abc123abc123abc123abc123-us1');
print_r($MailChimp->get('lists'));
```

Subscribe someone to a list

```php
use \DrewM\MailChimp\MailChimp;

$MailChimp = new MailChimp('abc123abc123abc123abc123abc123-us1');
$result = $MailChimp->post('lists/b1234346/members', array(
				'email_address'     => 'davy@example.com',
				'status'			=> 'subscribed',
				'merge_fields'      => array('FNAME'=>'Davy', 'LNAME'=>'Jones'),
			));
print_r($result);
```
